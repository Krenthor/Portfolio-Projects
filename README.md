# Finished-Resume-Projects
Completed small projects as code examples for a resume.



This I my current Coding Portfolio, these are the projects that I feel show my range as a coder. They are all written in python using PyCharm. 

As of writing this these are three of the different simple code challenges that I completed, FizzBuzz, a palindrome checker and Sum of 2 strings that are multiples of x. They are common introductory control flow challenges that I then added a GUI to which is why included them. I did this mainly as practice for Pysimple GUI and to experiment with their different input options , it also allowed me to limit at input the amount or types of inputs processed instead of coding in errors messages and exceptions.

Scrapping_mtggoldfish.py is a short scraping program I wrote to familiarize myself with several different libraries and their functionalities. One of my main hobbies is Magic the Gathering (MTG), an in-depth card game, based around deck building and play with a fast changing meta. To follow changes in the meta at a glance I created this program. 

MTG is made of over 20,000 unique cards that can be combined into different decks. Looking at price trends to see which individual cards are being bought is a good indication of were the meta is headed. MTG Goldfish is a website that among other things closely follows MTG finances. One of the main services this site provides is card price tracking, so I let them scrape the over 20,000 different MTG card prices from thousands of different shops. Compare price fluctuation and then condense it down into a top ten table. I then scraped the table with requests and Beautiful Soup, Rewrite it with Pandas, use Twilio an online phone service to text it to my self on an automated schedule using time and schedule libraries. 

The last program is a twitter bot I worked on with Selenium. I wanted to learn how to interact with webpages automatically, so I built this. Unlike the rest of my projects I did not build this one from the ground up. I was less familiar with the process and its such a common project I decided to not re-invent the wheel. I fallowed a tutorial on YouTube by DevEd. It was out of date so much of his code interacting with the actual Twitter html script had to be re-written. At execution it opens firefox, login into Twitter. Searches, in this case MTG, and then likes all tweets related to MTG. It is a simple program that was in introduction to basic automation and website navigation.
